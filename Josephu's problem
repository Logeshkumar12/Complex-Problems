#There are N people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed 
#direction. In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle 
#(which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
